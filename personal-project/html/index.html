	  		<div class="col-md-5"><p>Hello, my name is Andrew Cer. I spent most of my early childhood growing up right here in Colorado, in the town of Parker. However, right before middle school, my parents moved us out into the country as apparently Parker was too much of a city town for them. My parents built a house on a hill in what I felt was the middle of nowhere.  There wasn’t much of anything around and we had way more land than we knew what to do with. So what do most people do with lots of open land? Well, put cattle on it of course and my dad was no exception.</p></div>
	  		<div class="col-md-5"><p>Now imagine a skinny, goofy, tech kid like myself moving to a part of Colorado where throwing hay bales around the farm is a common pass time for most of its residence. High school was rough for me to say the least. The rest of my early adult life was spent trying to find my place in this world. A couple of years ago, I discovered the world of computer programming, more specifically, web development and I haven’t looked back. My development skills are far from where I would like them to be but, I know with the structure of gSchool and some very hard work, I can achieve my goals of doing what I love for a living.</p></div>

The video game hayday from my youth would have to be during the Nintendo 64 era. My older brother Matthew and I would stay up way past our bed time playing games like Golden Eye 64, Legend of Zelda, Perfect Dark, and NFL Blitz 64.</p>
        <p>I now play pretty much exclusively on the PC. MMO's, RPG's, shooters, I love them all. My Steam game list is coming close to 70 games now. Not that I’ve played that many but, steam sales usually get the better of me.</p></div>
