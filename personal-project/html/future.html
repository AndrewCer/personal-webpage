With the idea of not being picky for my first position as a developer, I don’t really care where it is at, so long as I feel like I am making a difference. For years I’ve worked jobs that feel utterly meaningless. Those type of jobs tend to suck the life right out of me. I want to be able to wake up in the morning and feel like I’m doing something that matters.</p></div>
	  		<div class="col-md-5"><p>My longterm goals involve getting a job at Blizzard Entertainment or perhaps Google. Towards the end of this course, I plan to apply to Blizzard just for the heck of it. It will be quite a long shot but, the worst they can say is no, which is basically what they are already saying if I don’t apply. My oldest brother currently works at Google. I would love to follow in his footsteps as it sounds like an amazing place to work. However, I don’t know if I will ever have the amount of programming knowledge and experience that it takes to work there.</p></div>

          <p>I feel very fortunate to have the opportunity to study at Galvanize. The first time I walked into the Denver building, my jaw dropped and I got chills. Never in my life have I felt such a sense of belonging. There is such an amazing atmosphere here. I am certain that in this environment, with lot of hard work, I will thrive. I eagerly look forward to all the networking opportunities that will be presented to us and I plan to take advantage of every single one of them. </p>

            <p>I would love to create a browser based video game. Chewing through the codecademy jQuery corse where I made the sprite move around with the arrow keys got me super excited. I have already started coming up with ideas on the game that I would like to create. Even though writing the code will be quite the difficult (yet super fun) experience, that doesn’t scare me as much as coming up with the art assets for the game. I plan to work on this game along side our gSchool corse work. I’m keeping my fingers crossed that this undertaking doesn't bury me in code.</p>
